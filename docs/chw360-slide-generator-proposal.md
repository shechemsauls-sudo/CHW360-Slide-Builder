# CHW360 Training Slide Generator
## Service Proposal

**Prepared for:** Shechem Sauls / CHW360
**Prepared by:** MiracleMind
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Transform your CHW training materials into polished, professional presentations with AI-powered content generation. Choose between a custom web-based presentation platform or automated Gamma deck generation - or both.

### Package Overview

| Package | Price | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **A: Web Platform** | $1,500 | Interactive training, modern UX, live sessions |
| **B: Gamma Decks** | $1,000 | Downloadable PPT/PDF, traditional workflows |
| **C: Full Suite** ⭐ | $2,000 | Maximum flexibility (save $500 vs. A+B) |

## The Opportunity

Your training content is comprehensive but time-consuming to format into presentations. Each 61-slide module requires:
- Manual slide creation and formatting
- Consistent branding application
- Presenter notes/talking tracks
- Multiple format outputs (web, PowerPoint, PDF)

**Our solution automates this entire workflow**, turning your Word documents into presentation-ready content in minutes instead of hours.

## Talking Tracks (Value Propositions)

### For Option A (Web Platform)

**Lead with:**
> "This isn't just a slide deck - it's an interactive training experience. Your facilitators can present from any device, learners can self-pace through modules, and everything stays on-brand without touching PowerPoint."

**Key Points:**
- "Modern learners expect interactive content, not static slides"
- "No software to install - works in any browser"
- "Automatic progress tracking for compliance documentation"
- "One update to the source, all presentations update instantly"
- "Mobile-friendly for field-based CHWs"

**Objection Handling:**
- *"But we need PowerPoint files"* → "Option C gives you both - web for live training, downloads for offline use"
- *"Our trainers aren't tech-savvy"* → "It's literally just scrolling - simpler than PowerPoint"

---

### For Option B (Gamma)

**Lead with:**
> "We turn your Word documents into polished slide decks automatically. What used to take hours now takes minutes, and you get professional-quality presentations every time."

**Key Points:**
- "AI handles the formatting so you focus on content"
- "Export to PowerPoint for trainers who prefer traditional tools"
- "Consistent branding across all modules automatically"
- "Generate presenter notes alongside slides"
- "Share links or download files - whatever works for your workflow"

**Objection Handling:**
- *"Will it look generic?"* → "Gamma has professional themes, and we customize colors to match your brand"
- *"What about our existing slides?"* → "This is for new content generation - we can migrate existing content too"

---

### For Option C (Full Suite)

**Lead with:**
> "Maximum flexibility - interactive web presentations for modern training delivery, plus downloadable decks for traditional workflows. One content source, every format you need."

**Key Points:**
- "Never choose between modern and traditional - have both"
- "Web platform for live sessions, Gamma decks for handouts"
- "Single source of truth for all training content"
- "Future-proof: add new formats as needs evolve"
- "Best value for comprehensive training programs"

**Objection Handling:**
- *"That's more than we need"* → "Start with Option A, add Gamma later - the architecture supports both"
- *"Budget concerns"* → "The monthly costs are minimal - this is about time savings, not software costs"
